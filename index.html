  <p class="textshort">From the machine to the human form; feelings to codes; numerical language of words. This idea is based on the concept of “meat-machineS” named by MIT professor Marvin Minsky, in 1958.  The machine’s humanization has begun a more and more truth in our days. Today, we can see that our cellphones project us. In a sense that they take our personalities, our preferences and can obey only to our voices. We sit in a world where this little devices took our place, we are represented by them on our social media, they know our music taste, the clothes we want to buy, the movies we prefer, all these because they  are linked to us, these “personas”. Busines and companies want our attention - That’s their product, so they look for the devices that projects the specific type of people they want, connect to them and have the perfect target for their business. Once more, here comes the question — In the end, do they want the metal machines or the meat machines?</p>

  <p class="textshort">From BEATS to BITS. This transaction  concept comes from The World Wide Web text, writen by that sees the Web, not only, as a “pool of human knowledge” but also,  as a “vast sea of human knowledge”. The humanization of the “metal machines” has begun a more and more truth in our days. Machines  acquires feelings, Intelligence and can even have relationships with humans. They’re almost humans, in fact, they were built by humans to act like humans so they could solve problems faster and better - than humans. These devices were taught to communicate as a human being, almost like an “imitation game.” Once more, here comes the question — What would happen if we could take some samples from this pool and analyze them?</p>

  <p class="textshort">Based on both concepts, “Meat Machines” and “Pool of Human Knowledge” comes to light this composition of an imaginary grocery shop  where you could buy all these “plug-ins” that make machines more human, and human more machines. Scientists have worked trough a path where a machine (for a positive empact) have a more human-like form and capacities, we speack of iltelegence, fellings, personalities etc... this compositions is a extra materialized idea of the human caracteristics that have been materialized before taking the shape of machines.</p>
